<h2>The Life of Buddha and Its Lessons</h2>
<hr style="width:65%"  />

<p>The thoughtful student, in scanning the religious history of the race,
has one fact continually forced upon his notice, <i>viz</i>., that there is
an invariable tendency to deify whomsoever shows himself superior to
the weakness of our common humanity. Look where we will, we find the
saint-like man exalted into a divine personage and worshipped for a
god. Though perhaps misunderstood, reviled and even persecuted while
living, the apotheosis is almost sure to come after death: and the
victim of yesterday's mob, raised to the state of an Intercessor in
Heaven, is besought with prayer and tears, and placatory penances, to
mediate with God for the pardon of human sin. This is a mean and vile
trait of human nature, the proof of ignorance, selfishness, brutal
cowardice, and a superstitious materialism. It shows the base instinct
to put down and destroy whatever or whoever makes men feel their own
imperfections; with the alternative of ignoring and denying these very
imperfections by turning into gods men who have merely spiritualised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
their natures, so that it may be supposed that they were heavenly
incarnations and not mortal like other men.</p>

<p>This process of euhemerisation, as it is called, or the making of men
into gods and gods into men, sometimes, though more rarely, begins
during the life of the hero, but usually after death. The true history
of his life is gradually amplified and decorated with fanciful
incidents, to fit it to the new character which has been posthumously
given him. Omens and portents are now made to attend his earthly
avat&#803;&#257;ra: his precocity is described as superhuman: as a babe or
lisping child he silences the wisest logicians by his divine
knowledge: miracles he produces as other boys do soap-bubbles: the
terrible energies of nature are his playthings: the gods, angels, and
demons are his habitual attendants: the sun, moon, and all the starry
host wheel around his cradle in joyful measures, and the earth thrills
with joy at having borne such a prodigy: and at his last hour of
mortal life the whole universe shakes with conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>Why need I use the few moments at my disposal to marshal before you
the various personages of whom these fables have been written? Let it
suffice to recall the interesting fact to your notice, and invite you
to compare the respective biographies of the Br&#257;hman&#803;ical
Kr&#803;s&#803;hn&#803;a, the Persian Zoroaster, the Egyptian Hermes, the
Indian Gaut&#803;ama, and the canonical, especially the apocryphal,
Jesus. Taking Kr&#803;s&#803;hn&#803;a or Zoroaster, as you please, as the most
ancient, and coming down the chronological line of descent, you will
find them all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> made after the same pattern. The real personage is all
covered up and concealed under the embroidered veils of the romancer
and the enthusiastic historiographer. What is surprising to me is that
this tendency to exaggeration and hyperbole is not more commonly
allowed for by those who in our days attempt to discuss and compare
religions. We are constantly and painfully reminded that the prejudice
of inimical critics, on the one hand, and the furious bigotry of
devotees, on the other, blind men to fact and probability, and lead to
gross injustice. Let me take as an example the mythical biographies of
Jesus. At the time when the Council of Nicea was convened for settling
the quarrels of certain bishops, and for the purpose of examining into
the canonicity of the three hundred more or less apocryphal gospels
that were being read in the Christian churches as inspired writings,
the history of the life of Christ had reached the height of absurd
myth. We may see some specimens in the extant books of the apocryphal
New Testament, but most of them are now lost. What have been retained
in the present Canon may doubtless be regarded as the least
objectionable. And yet we must not hastily adopt even this conclusion,
for you know that Sabina, Bishop of Heracha, himself speaking of the
Council of Nicea, affirms that "except Constantine and Sabinus, Bishop
of Pamphilus, these bishops were a set of illiterate, simple creatures
that understood nothing"; which is as though he had said they were a
pack of fools. And Pappus, in his <i>Synodicon</i> to that Council of
Nicea, lets us into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> secret that the Canon was not decided by a
careful comparison of several gospels before them, but by a <i>lottery</i>.
Having, he tells us, "promiscuously put all the books that were
referred to the Council for determination under a Communion table in a
church, they (the bishops) besought the Lord that the inspired
writings might get up on the table, while the spurious writings
remained underneath, and <i>it happened accordingly</i>".</p>

<p>But letting all this pass and looking only to what is contained in the
present Canon, we see the same tendency to compel all nature to attest
the divinity of the writer's hero. At the nativity a star leaves its
orbit and leads the Persian astrologers to the divine child, and
angels come and converse with shepherds, and a whole train of like
celestial phenomena occurs at various stages of his earthly career,
which closes amid earthquakes, a pall of darkness over the whole
scene, a supernatural war of the elements, the opening of graves and
the walking about of their tenants, and other appalling wonders. Now,
if the candid Bud&#803;d&#803;hist concedes that the real history of
Gaut&#803;ama is embellished by like absurd exaggerations, and if we can
find their duplicates in the biographies of Zoroaster,
Shan&#775;kar&#257;ch&#257;rya and other real personages of antiquity, have
we not the right to conclude that the true history of the Founder of
Christianity, if at this late date it were possible to write it, would
be very different from the narratives that pass current? We must not
forget that Jerusalem was at that time a Roman dependency,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> just as
Ceylon is now a British, and that the silence of contemporary Roman
historians about any such violent disturbances of the equilibrium of
nature is deeply significant.</p>

<p>I have cited this example for the sole and simple purpose of bringing
home to the non-Bud&#803;d&#803;histic portion of my present audience the
conviction that, in considering the life of S&#257;kya Muni and the
lessons it teaches, they must not make his followers of to-day
responsible for any extravagant exuberances of past biographers. The
doctrine of Bud&#803;d&#803;ha and its effects are to be judged quite apart
from the man, just as the doctrine ascribed to Jesus and its effects
are to be considered quite irrespectively of his personal history.
And&mdash;as I hope I have shown&mdash;the actual doings and sayings of every
founder of a Faith or a school of philosophy must be sought for under
a heap of tinsel and rubbish contributed by successive generations of
followers.</p>

<p>Approaching the question of the hour in this spirit of precaution,
what do we find are the probabilities respecting the life of S&#257;kya
Muni? Who was he? When did he live? How did he live? What did he
teach? A most careful comparison of authorities and analysis of
evidence establishes, I think, the following data:</p>

<p>1. He was the son of a king.</p>

<p>2. He lived between six and seven centuries before Christ.</p>

<p>3. He resigned his royal state and went to live in the jungle, and
among the lowest and most unhappy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> classes, so as to learn the secret
of human pain and misery by personal experience: tested every known
austerity of the Hind&#803;&#363; ascetics and excelled them all in his power
of endurance: sounded every depth of woe in search of the means to
alleviate it: and at last came out victorious, and showed the world
the way to salvation.</p>

<p>4. What he taught may be summed up in a few words, as the perfume of
many roses may be distilled into a few drops of <i>attar</i>: Everything in
the world of Matter is unreal; the only reality is in the world of
Spirit. Emancipate yourselves from the tyranny of the former; strive
to attain the latter. The Rev. Samuel Beal, in his <i>Catena of
Bud&#803;d&#803;hist Scriptures from the Chinese</i> puts it differently. "The
idea underlying the Buddhist religious system is," he says, "simply
this: 'all is vanity'. Earth is a show, and Heaven is a vain reward."
Primitive Bud&#803;d&#803;hism was engrossed, absorbed, by one thought&mdash;the
vanity of finite existence, the priceless value of the one condition
of Eternal Rest.</p>

<p>If I have the temerity to prefer my own definition of the spirit of
Bud&#803;d&#803;ha's doctrine, it is because I think that all the
misconceptions of it have arisen from a failure to understand his idea
of what is real and what is unreal, what worth longing and striving
for and what not. From this misconception have come all the unfounded
charges that Bud&#803;d&#803;hism is an "atheistical," that is to say, a
grossly materialistic, a nihilistic, a negative, a vice-breeding
religion. Bud&#803;d&#803;hism denies the existence of a personal
God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>&mdash;true: therefore&mdash;well, therefore, and notwithstanding all this,
its teaching is neither what may be called properly atheistical,
nihilistic, negative, nor provocative of vice. I will try to make my
meaning clear, and the advancement of modern scientific research helps
in this direction. Science divides the universe for us into two
elements&mdash;matter and force; accounting for their phenomena by their
combinations, and making both eternal and obedient to eternal and
immutable law. The speculations of men of science have carried them to
the outermost verge of the physical universe. Behind them lie not only
a thousand brilliant triumphs by which a part of Nature's secrets have
been wrung from her, but also more thousands of failures to fathom her
deep mysteries. They have proved thought material, since it is the
evolution of the gray tissue of the brain, and a recent German
experimentalist, Professor Dr. J&auml;ger, claims to have proved that
man's soul is "a volatile odoriferous principle, capable of solution
in glycerine". Psychogen is the name he gives to it, and his
experiments show that it is present not merely in the body as a whole,
but in every individual cell, in the ovum, and even in the ultimate
elements of protoplasm. I need hardly say to so intelligent an
audience as this, that these highly interesting experiments of Dr.
J&auml;ger are corroborated by many facts, both physiological and
psychological, that have been always noticed among all nations; facts
which are woven into popular proverbs, legends, folk-lore fables,
mythologies and theologies, the world over. Now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> if thought is matter
and soul is matter, then Bud&#803;d&#803;ha, in recognising the impermanence
of sensual enjoyment or experience of any kind, and the instability of
every material form, the human soul included, uttered a profound and
scientific truth, And since the very idea of gratification or
suffering is inseparable from that of material being&mdash;absolute <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>
alone being regarded by common consent as perfect, changeless and
Eternal&mdash;therefore, in teaching the doctrine that conquest of the
material self, with all its lusts, desires, loves, hopes, ambitions
and hates, frees one from pain, and leads to Nirv&#257;n&#803;a, the state
of Perfect Rest, he preached the rest of an untinged, untainted
existence in the Spirit. Though the soul be composed of the finest
conceivable substance, yet if substance at all&mdash;as Dr. J&auml;ger seems
able to prove, and ages of human intercourse with the weird phantoms
of the shadow world imply&mdash;it must in time perish. What remains is
that changeless part of man, which most philosophers call Spirit, and
Nirv&#257;n&#803;a is its necessary condition of existence. The only
dispute between Bud&#803;d&#803;hist authorities is whether this
Nirv&#257;n&#803;ic existence is attended with individual consciousness, or
whether the individual is merged in the whole, as the extinguished
flame is lost in the air. But there are those who say that the flame
has not been annihilated by the blowing out. It has only passed out of
the visible world of matter into the invisible world of Spirit, where
it still exists and will ever exist, as a bright reality. Such
thinkers can understand Bud&#803;d&#803;ha's doctrine and, while agreeing
with him that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> soul is not immortal, would spurn the charge of
materialistic nihilism, if brought against either that sublime teacher
or themselves.</p>

<p>The history of S&#257;kya Muni's life is the strongest bulwark of his
religion. As long as the human heart is capable of being touched by
tales of heroic self-sacrifice, accompanied by purity and celestial
benevolence of motive, it will cherish his memory. Why should I go
into the particulars of that noble life? You will remember that he was
the son of the king of Kapilavast&#803;u&mdash;a mighty sovereign whose
opulence enabled him to give the heir of his house every luxury that a
voluptuous imagination could desire: and that the future Bud&#803;d&#803;ha
was not allowed even to know, much less observe, the miseries of
ordinary existence. How beautifully Edwin Arnold has painted for us in
<i>The Light of Asia</i> the luxury and languor of that Indian Court,
"where love was gaoler and delights its bars". We are told that:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The king commanded that within those walls<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No mention should be made of age or death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow or pain, or sickness ...<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And every dawn the dying rose was plucked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dead leaves hid, all evil sights removed:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For said the king, "If he shall pass his youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from such things as move to wistfulness<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And brooding on the empty eggs of thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadow of this fate, too vast for man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">May fade, belike, and I shall see him grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that great stature of fair sovereignty,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When he shall rule all lands&mdash;if he <i>will rule</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king of kings and glory of his time."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>You know how vain were all the precautions taken by the father to
prevent the fulfilment of the prophecy that his beloved son would be
the coming Bud&#803;d&#803;ha. Though all suggestions of death were banished
from the royal palace, though the city was bedecked with flowers and
gay flags, and every painful object removed from sight when the young
Prince Sid&#803;d&#803;&#257;rtha visited it, yet the decrees of destiny were
not to be baffled, the "voices of the spirits," the "wandering winds"
and the d&#803;evas, whispered the truth of human sorrows into his
listening ear, and when the appointed hour arrived, the Sud&#803;d&#803;ha
D&#803;evas threw the spell of slumber over the household, steeped in
profound lethargy the sentinels (as we are told was done by an angel
to the gaolers of Peter's prison), rolled back the triple gates of
bronze, strewed the sweet moghra-flowers thickly beneath his horse's
feet to muffle every sound, and he was free. Free? Yes&mdash;to resign
every earthly comfort, every sensuous enjoyment, the sweets of royal
power, the homage of a Court, the delights of domestic life: gems, the
glitter of gold: rich stuffs, rich food, soft beds: the songs of
trained musicians, and of birds kept prisoners in gay cages, the
murmur of perfumed waters plashing in marble basins, the delicious
shade of trees in gardens where art had contrived to make nature even
lovelier than herself. He leaps from his saddle when at a safe
distance from the palace, flings the jewelled rein to his faithful
groom, Channa, cuts off his flowing locks, gives his rich costume to a
hunter in exchange for his own, plunges into the jungle, and is free:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To tread its paths with patient, stainless feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Making its dusty bed, its loneliest wastes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My dwelling, and its meanest things my mates:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Clad in no prouder garb than outcasts wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fed with no meals save what the charitable<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Give of their will, sheltered by no more pomp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the dim cave lends or the jungle-bush.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This will I do because the woeful cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of life and all flesh living cometh up<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into my ears, and all my soul is full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pity for the sickness of this world:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which I will heal, if healing may be found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By uttermost renouncing and strong strife.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus masterfully does Sir Edwin Arnold depict the sentiment which
provoked this Great Renunciator. The testimony of thousands of
millions who, during the last twenty-five centuries, have professed
the Bud&#803;d&#803;histic religion, proves that the secret of human misery
was at last solved by this divine self-sacrifice, and the true path to
Nirv&#257;n&#803;a opened.</p>

<p>The joy that he brought to the hearts of others, Bud&#803;d&#803;ha first
tasted himself. He found that the pleasures of the eye, the ear, the
taste, touch and smell are fleeting and deceptive: he who gives value
to them brings only disappointment and bitter sorrow upon himself. The
social differences between men he found were equally arbitrary and
illusive; caste bred hatred and selfishness; riches strife, envy and
malice. So in founding his Faith he laid the bottom of its
foundation-stones upon all this worldly dirt, and its dome in the
clear serene of the world of Spirit. He who can mount to a clear
conception of Nirv&#257;n&#803;a will find his thought far away above the
common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> joys and sorrows of petty men. As to one who ascends to the
top of Chimborazo or the Him&#257;layan crags, and sees men on the
earth's surface crawling to and fro like ants, so equally small do
bigots and sectarians appear to him. The mountain climber has under
his feet the very clouds from whose sun-painted shapes the poet has
figured to himself the golden streets and glittering domes of the
materialistic Heaven of a personal God. Below him are all the various
objects out of which the world's pantheons have been manufactured:
around, above&mdash;Immensity. And so also, far down the ascending plane of
thought that leads from the earth towards the Infinite, the
philosophic Bud&#803;d&#803;hist describes, at different plateaux, the
heavens and hells, the gods and demons, of the materialistic
creed-builders.</p>

<p>What are the lessons to be derived from the life and teachings of this
heroic prince of Kapilavast&#803;u? Lessons of gratitude and benevolence.
Lessons of tolerance for the clashing opinions of men who live, move
and have their being, think and aspire, only in the material world.
The lesson of a common tie of brotherhood among all men. Lessons of
manly self-reliance, of equanimity in breasting whatsoever of good or
ill may happen. Lessons of the meanness of the rewards, the pettiness
of the misfortunes of a shifting world of illusions. Lessons of the
necessity for avoiding every species of evil thought and word, and for
doing, speaking and thinking everything that is good, and for the
bringing of the mind into subjection so that these may be accomplished
without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> selfish motive or vanity. Lessons of self-purification and
communion, by which the illusiveness of externals and the value of
internals are understood.</p>

<p>Well might St. Hilaire burst into the panegyric that Bud&#803;d&#803;ha "is
the perfect model of all the virtues he preaches ... his life has not
a stain upon it". Well might the sober critic Max M&uuml;ller pronounce his
moral code "one of the most perfect which the world has ever known".
No wonder that in contemplating that gentle life Edwin Arnold should
have found his personality "the highest, gentlest, holiest and most
beneficent ... in the history of thought," and been moved to write his
splendid verses. It is twenty-five hundred years since humanity put
forth such a flower: who knows when it did before?</p>

<p>Gaut&#803;ama Bud&#803;d&#803;ha, S&#257;kya Muni, has ennobled the whole human
race. His fame is our common inheritance. His Law is the law of
Justice, providing for every good thought, word and deed its fair
reward, for every evil one its proper punishment. His law is in
harmony with the voices of Nature, and the evident equilibrium of the
universe. It yields nothing to importunities or threats, can be
neither coaxed nor bribed by offerings to abate or alter one jot or
tittle of its inexorable course. Am I told that Bud&#803;d&#803;hist laymen
display vanity in their worship and ostentation in their almsgiving;
that they are fostering sects as bitterly as Hind&#803;&#363;s? So much the
worse for the laymen: there is the example of Bud&#803;d&#803;ha and his
Law. Am I told that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> Bud&#803;d&#803;hist priests are ignorant, idle
fosterers of superstitions grafted on their religion by foreign kings?
So much the worse for the priests: the life of their Divine Master
shames them and shows their unworthiness to wear his yellow robe or
carry his beggar's bowl. There is the Law&mdash;immutable&mdash;menacing; it
will find them out and punish.</p>

<p>And what shall we say to those of another caste of character&mdash;the
humble-minded, charitable, tolerant, religiously aspiring hearts among
the laity, and the unselfish, pure and learned of the priests who know
the Precepts and keep them? The Law will find them out also; and when
the book of each life is written up and the balance struck, every good
thought or deed will be found entered in its proper place. Not one
blessing that ever followed them from grateful lips throughout their

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
